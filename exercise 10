	the function needs to create a new array,

	which contain the same length of data as input,

	with each position as a result of multiplication
		of every data from the input "EXCEPT" the data in that position itself.


	> PROCESS is multiplicating every data in the array, except one which have the same index value as the index where the data is being inputted after.
	PROCESS EQUALS:
		DEFINING input.length
		initiate loop1 that count for each data index in the inputted array, starts from index 0, this step is to be repeated for as long as input.length
		initiate loop2 that count for each data index in the inputted array that is to be multiplied with, starts from index 0
		initiate conditional where
			IF index loop1 DOES-NOT-EQUAL index loop2 THEN
			the first value from index of loop2 is stored to be multiplied later
			index loop2 moves forward
			back to IF
			END-IF
			Outside of the specified condition, index loop2 to be moved forward until condition specified is met
			
			
		

	therefore..
	> function should only do PROCESS, if INITIAL INDEX != TARGET INDEX
